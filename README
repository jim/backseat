Backseat is a proof of concept that uses Rjb to directly interact with the WebDriver Java classes. I'm still thinking about the API, so no specs just yet.

EXAMPLES:
    Please see firefox_example.rb and htmlunit_example.rb in the examples directory for implementations of the 2 official WebDriver examples from http://code.google.com/p/webdriver/wiki/GettingStarted.

REQUIREMENTS:
    a working JVM- you may need to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH http://rjb.rubyforge.org/
    rjb - sudo gem install rjb, if you're on a Mac go here: http://www.digitalsanctum.com/2008/02/02/gem-install-rjb-on-mac-os-x-leopard/
